what is key constraints ?
 provides limitations on any tables there we used key constraints 
  types of key constraints 

  a) primary key 
  b) unique key 
  c) foreign key 
  d) compound key 


  a) primary key : A pk is provides a once time in a tables 
                   A Pk key is used to provides unique identify in a tables 
                   A pk key never return a null values 


                   user 

         id(pk)     name     pass    age     address     pin            
         

         
  a) primary key : A pk is provides a once time in a tables 
                   A Pk key is used to provides unique identify in a tables 
                   A pk key never return a null values 


                   user 

         id(pk)     name     pass    age     address     pin            
         


    b) unique key : A uk is provides more than   once time in a tables 
                    A uk key is used to provides unique identify in a tables on any columns  
                    A uk key is not null 
                    A uk never return a dublicate values  




                   user 

         id(pk)     name  email(uk)      pass    age     address     pin    adharnumber(uk)   mobile(uk)





    c) foreign key : A fk is provides more than   once time in a tables 
                    A fk key is used to provides relationship one tables to another tables with common field  
                    A fk key is not null 
                    A fk return dublicate data  


     
                   country

        cid(pk)   cname
        1          india
        2          canada 


                   user 

         id(pk)     name    email(uk)      pass    age     address     pin    adharnumber(uk)   mobile(uk)  cid(fk)

   SQL Join ... 
     sql join is used to join more than one tables of matched data from first table to another tables 


   examples : select  tbl_employee.*,countryname from tbl_employee join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id; 

   or 


   select  empid,name,email,adharnumber,pin,countryname from tbl_employee join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id; 

   or

   select  empid,name,email,countryname from tbl_employee join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id;                  



  
     types of join ... 

      a) inner join 
      b) join 
      c) outer join 

             1) left join 
             2) right join 
             3) full join 

       d) cross join  



    Note : full join is not supported in mysql 


         
         
         a) join   :

            select  tbl_employee.*,countryname from tbl_employee join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id; 

   or 


   select  empid,name,email,adharnumber,pin,countryname from tbl_employee join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id; 

   or

   select  empid,name,email,countryname from tbl_employee join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id;                  



  b) inner join : join and inner join is almost same 

           select  tbl_employee.*,countryname from tbl_employee inner join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id; 

   or 


   select  empid,name,email,adharnumber,pin,countryname from tbl_employee  inner join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id; 

   or

   select  empid,name,email,countryname from tbl_employee inner join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id;                  



   c) outer join :  

          a) left join : left join is used to join matched data from first table of left rows to second tables of left rows if data matched join all data otherwise return null values
           
             
             examples : 

                  
   select  empid,name,email,countryname from tbl_employee left join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id;                  




      b) right join : right join is used to join matched data from second table of right rows to first tables of right rows if data matched join all data otherwise return null values
           
             
             examples : 

                  
   select  empid,name,email,countryname from tbl_employee right join tbl_country on tbl_employee.country_id=tbl_country.country_id;                  





 4) cross join : cross join is used to join more than one tables and return a cross (multiplication of each rows) and return a dublicate of repeated data many times 


                examples : select * from  tbl_employee cross join tbl_country;    
            

                                   A 

                            B       C      D

                    E    F   G     H    I   J   K  L
